This will be a data scraper for EPL stats from the Premier League website ⚽️

Node packages used:
 - Request-Promise: request library to ensure we're getting proper responses
 - Checksum: will make a hash of our response instead of thousands of line of html; easier to compare for changes
 - Cheerio: ingests HTML markup and makes it into an accessible JavaSCript API
